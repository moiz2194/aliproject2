                These days, there are plenty of options for those who drive to earn income. Before drivers align
                themselves with any company, they should understand the important difference between revenue and profit.
                While some of the larger companies casually discuss potential earnings, their drivers report significant
                losses due to downtime, shifts in policies (some drivers even boycotted), and most shocking are the
                devastating overhead costs associated with driving your personal vehicle for 40 hours per week. We
                havenâ€™t even mentioned stories of some of their obnoxious customers.

                Established in 2016, Phlete is a GPS-trackable mobile application connecting pre-screened drivers with
                vehicle owners who want to have their cars driven and delivered to and from maintenance appointments.

                        Because you are not earning with your personal vehicle, your profits are not impacted by fuel and vehicle maintenance costs.

                        Signing up early puts you in position to get a greater share of earnings before more drivers join.
